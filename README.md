# GregCustom
A responsive Wcms theme with resources to aid customisation.

## Preview
On installation will look like this
![Wide screen preview](/previewwide.jpg)

The header showing the blue background and logo disc is an easily deleted or substituted background image. If deleted, by default the plain dark blue background colour is revealed. All text above the menu bar is taken from fields on the "Settings > Menu" and "Settings > Current Page" screens. When sub-pages are added the menu shows these on drop-downs beneath the top level item

![Narrow screen preview](/previewnarrow.jpg)

On narrow screens the Site and Page titles switch the left alignment and an alternative background image is displayed. The menu always shows the HOME page. Further options are revealed by clicking the [&equiv;] button.

The menu reveals sub-pages on a hover action, producing the usual problems on touchscreen devices. (I am not aware of a coding technique to avoid such touchscreen issues, without editing to the index.php file, which is not recommended by Wcms.)

Currently, the stylesheet dos not support multiple sub-page levels.
