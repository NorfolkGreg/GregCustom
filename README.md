# GregCustom
A responsive Wcms theme with resources to aid customisation.

## Preview - Wide Screens
On installation screens wider than 600px will look like this:

![Wide screen preview](/previewwide.jpg)

The body of any page is limited to a maximum 900px wide.

All text above the menu bar is taken from fields on the "Settings > Menu" and "Settings > Current Page" screens. (See "Theme Limitations" below on the implications of this.)

## Preview - Narrow Screens
![Narrow screen preview](/previewnarrow.jpg)

On narrow screens the Site and Page titles switch to left alignment and the menu always shows the HOME page. Further menu options are revealed by clicking the [&equiv;] button. Sub-pages appear on a hover action.

## Other Features
### Theme Limitations:
Due to the way fields from the Settings pages are used for the site header, the "Simple Blog" plugin is incompatable with the theme.
Currently, the stylesheet only supports one level of sub-pages.
### The Menu System
When sub-pages are added, on hover, the menu shows these on drop-downs beneath the top level item

## Customisation Resources
Before activating the theme it is recommended that the "resources" folder is downloaded and deleted from the server as it performs no function there. It contains a number of images and other files that should help explain how to make best use of the theme.
### ReadMe.txt
Within the "resources" folder will be fund a “ReadMe.txt” file. This covers the following topics:
#### Colour Schemes
How to use the list of variables setting the colour definitions for the theme. A number of sample colour scheme declarations are provied together with preview images of them.
#### Header Area
Notes concerning the "Page Contents" part of the header area and a description of how to add images in the header area that replace the default plain colour background. The resources include sample images to show how this feature can be used.
#### Suggested Tweaks
A note on a potential improvement for search engine results.
#### Image Display
A description of the effects of the styling code for images.
#### Video and Audio
Notes on the code required to take advantage of the features of the theme when incuding video and audio files.

## Future Development
Contributions of additional colour schemes and header backgrounds that can be included in the "resources" folder in future versions of the theme are welcome together with any suggestions for tweaks to the theme.php or style.css file that you think may be useful to others.
